Lets learn about pelicans a little.
Pelicans are splendid fliers, and can soar like eagles with their giant wings. Getting UP in the air can be challenging without the help of the wind. Pelicans must run over the water while beating their big wings and pounding the surface of the water with both feet in unison to get enough speed for takeoff.


Along with the giant pouch, pelicans are a large bird with short legs, and they appear rather clumsy on land. Once in the water, they are strong swimmers, thanks to their webbed feet. Pelicans and their relatives—cormorants, gannets, and boobies—are the only birds with totipalmate feet. This means that webbing connects all four of their toes, even the back toe. Pelicans also get a little help staying afloat: air pockets in their skeleton and beneath their wings provide added buoyancy. And the birds use their bill to coat their feathers with a waterproof oil from a gland at the base of the tail. This keeps their feathers from becoming waterlogged and weighing them down.

It is easy to identify pelicans, because they are one of the only birds with a pouch under their bill. There is a famous limerick that begins, “A wonderful bird is the pelican, his bill can hold more than his ‘belican’….” This enormous, naked skin pouch hangs from the lower half of the pelican's long, straight bill, hooked at the tip. The bird uses this pouch to catch fish and, as the limerick says, its bill does indeed hold more than its "belly can"! The unique pouch is also helpful in warm weather. While roosting in the hot sun, pelicans open their bill and flap the pouch to cool off.



End in Festivals,
End in cultural Farewell,
Happy pelican Festival.
