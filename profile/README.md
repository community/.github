#### Quick note on 3rd party integrations
> _Due to an overwhelming number of suspicious requests from community members for 3rd party apps and integrations to this org, we've turned off "Allow integration requests from outside collaborators"._

#### Quick note on temporary interaction limits
In an effort to reduce spammy behavior, we are instituting temporary interaction limits to bar accounts less than 24hrs-old from participating in the `github.com/community` Discussions space. 
Accounts that are at least 24hrs old will be able to post and interact as normal.

If your account is less than 24hrs old and you have a question, please try using the Discussions search bar above to see if your question has already been asked or simply wait a day. We apologize if this causes any inconvenience.

If you'd like to learn more about implementing temporary interaction limits in your own orgs and repos, please read up on the official documentation [here](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/moderating-comments-and-conversations/limiting-interactions-in-your-organization).
